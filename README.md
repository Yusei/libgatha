Provides three algorithms to find Nash equilibria in games: Sastry
(reinforcement learning), MCB (a modified version of Sastry taking
advantage of SMP processing) and SFP (Sampled Fictitious Player).

Games can be modeled in Normal Form (ie. with a payoff matrix) or with
an arbitrary payoff function.

Results and algorithm progression can be visualized through SVG files.

See example folders for basic examples.
